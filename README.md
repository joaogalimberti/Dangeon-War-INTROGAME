# **🎮 Dungeon War - INTROGAME**

This is the final project of the Introduction to Python Programming course, offered by the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES). Using the Pygame library and the VSCode IDE, I developed this game called Dungeon War - INTROGAME. During the development of this project, I was able to learn and apply various programming concepts, as well as explore creativity in building an RPG game.

## 🔍 About the Game
Dungeon War is an RPG game where each player controls a team of three characters. Players embark on a long adventure, commanding the actions of their heroes and interacting with other characters in the game world.

## 📖 Characters' Story

Training daily in self-defense and hunting for sustenance, Lesly inherits her father's armor, a recognized warrior. She sets off with her team to the Dungeon War, challenging stereotypes in an era of gender prejudice.

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics
When running the game, a menu will be displayed, offering options to play, view credits, or exit. Selecting "Play" will take the user to the character selection screen, where they can choose their team. Selection is confirmed with the "Z" key. During the game, players have a predetermined order, but when an ally or enemy dies, another character is summoned to avenge them. The battle continues until one team is victorious. Winners are rewarded with INTROCOINS.

## 💻 Development with Pygame and VSCode

This project was developed using the Pygame library for game creation and the VSCode IDE for code editing. Below are the documentations and references for both tools.

### Pygame

Pygame is a Python game development library. It provides functionality for creating 2D games, including graphics, audio, and user interaction.
