# **🎮 Dungeon War - INTROGAME**

This is the final project of the Introduction to Python Programming course, offered by the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES). Using the Pygame library and the VSCode IDE, I developed this game called Dungeon War - INTROGAME. During the development of this project, I was able to learn and apply various programming concepts, as well as explore creativity in building an RPG game.

## 🔍 About the Game
Dungeon War is an RPG game where each player controls a team of three characters. Players embark on a long adventure, commanding the actions of their heroes and interacting with other characters in the game world.
